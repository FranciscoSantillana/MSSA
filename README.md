# Microsoft Systems and Software Academy (MSSA)
Things I worked on at the start of my programming adventure.

## Math App:
 This Math App exercise is something I am proud of. Overall it is a simple calculator for the user. 
I used a class library and created a calculator class for my first time. 
I also tried implementing the use of methods for code I was likely to repeat. 
I also implemented a simple error handler to have more control of the inputs.

## Calculating Averages: 
This exercise challenged my ability to think outside the box while writing less code. 
I used FOR and WHILE loops for the first time, and I also tried to invoke a method that displays a student's grade when applied toan average.

## Concatenation-Discount-Quotient-and-Remainder:
 In this little exercise I tried to use Concatenation to join two separate strings into one.
I also did a Discount exercise where I prompted for a price and a discount from the user and gave them a new price. 
I also wrote a program where I prompt the user for two integers and then calculated the quotient and remainder.

## BMI Calculator: 
In this exercise I started using different methods that returned specific values. 
On my FindMin method I created two IF statements that will calculate the lowest value of two integers. 
On my second method called BMI, i had a couple of IF statements that reacted to a certain variable that depended on the user's height and weight.

## Mathematical Expressions:
 On this project I learned how to write out four different mathematical problems. 
Although a simple task for many, I had fun learning how C# interacts with operators and mathematical expressions.

## Errors and Exceptions: 
Added errors an exceptions to my original "Calculating Averages" solution.

## Inheritance and Extensions: 
Worked with simple inheritance and extensions to further understand how it works.

## Military Unit (Implementing Inheritance): 
I applied my knowledge on the fundamentals of creating base and derived class, including the usage of virtual methods and learning how to override them. The methods basically returned strings for the sake of understanding how the fundamentals work.

## CLassPartyInvites
I learned the very basics of MVC, separation of concerns, HTML5, and CSS while working on an RSVP-based website.

## Razor
Understanding how Razor allows HTML and C# to cooperate. Learned how to use decision statements with Razor on ASP.NET Core Web Application.
